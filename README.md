Regular Expression Plugin - SAMPCTL compatible version
====================

This is a basic plugin based on Oniguruma library that allows the use of regular expressions in samp scripting.

As it is stated in this link http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/reb.shtml , onig is the fastest regex library at the moment. Even so, you must consider that it uses an BT-based alogrithm, so passing an non appropriate syntax, could take a lot of time to process on big strings. (Personally, i never encountered this problem).

This is a fork of old samp plugin with modification that enables sampctl to execute it's binaries in order to turn on server, for more comfortable development purposes.
